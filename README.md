# Downloads Folder Management Program

This app helps you to manage the files in your downloads folder by organizing each filetype into its seperate folder.

I am still working on updating the .exe file but the python version has some quality of life fixes like:

Creating only one directory pertaining to the specific filetypes you want to organize.
A more modern design.

You can either use the exe file which is a lot simpler OR you can use the program with python by itself, you will have to install the dependencies if you take this route which includes: 

```pip install pathlib``` , ```pip install os```,```pip install shutil``` , ```pip install ttkbootstrap```
