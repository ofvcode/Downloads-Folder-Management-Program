# Downloads Folder Management Program

This app helps you to manage the files in your downloads folder by organizing each filetype into its seperate folder.

You can either use the exe file which is a lot simpler OR you can use the program with python by itself, you will have to install the dependencies if you take this route which includes: 

```pip install pathlib``` , ```pip install os```,```pip install shutil```
